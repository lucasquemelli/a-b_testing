# 1. Business Problem

**Description**

---

Eletronic House is an e-commerce enterprise. We want to perform A/B testing to know what website layout will result in better conversion. Conversion is defined as the number of user who purchased products. Mainly, we want 2% higher conversion than the current webpage.

**Motivation**

---

Performing A/B testing is important in the case of Eletronic House, an e-commerce enterprise, because it allows us to scientifically compare different website layouts to determine which one leads to better conversion rates. In this context, conversion refers to the number of users who make purchases on the website.

By conducting A/B testing, Eletronic House can create two versions of their website layout: the current layout (version A) and a modified version (version B). These versions will be shown to different groups of users randomly selected from their target audience. By tracking the conversion rates of both versions, Eletronic House can determine which layout performs better in terms of driving purchases.

In this specific case, Eletronic House aims to achieve a conversion rate that is 2% higher than their current webpage. A/B testing allows them to objectively measure whether the modified layout (version B) meets this goal. If version B outperforms version A and achieves the desired 2% increase in conversion rate, Eletronic House can confidently implement the changes to their website, knowing that it is likely to result in higher sales.

Overall, A/B testing provides Eletronic House with valuable insights into the effectiveness of different website layouts in driving conversions, helping them make data-driven decisions to optimize their e-commerce platform for increased sales and improved user experience.
